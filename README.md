# Data Structures and Algorithms Solutions with explanations!

A repo for some of my solved DSA problems with explanations and implementations in C, C++, Java, and/or Python!
Many of these are from Leetcode, HackerRank, CodeSignal, AlgoExpert or other software engineering interview
prep sites where we are given assessments/scenarios.

# Google Sheets with completed / explanations
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ZhhiO3YC_CBuzD4zAuXObglvdMv5A4_kZzLSn3QKfY/edit?usp=sharing
(not entirely up to date with this repo --  this repo will always be more up to date than the google sheet)

# How to search in my completed solutions
I organize these problems by the type of category they fall into: Dynamic Programming, Arrays, Strings, etc...
I format the problems like so: problemInCamelcase_methodN_platform.langaugeType

EXAMPLE:

    groupAnagrams_method1_leetcode.py

Looking for problem "Group Anagrams" from Leetcode.

_There may be multiple methods I have muliple implementations of this problem that work slightly differently, so method1 is just implementation #1 that is a valid solution to the problem._

_This solution was implemented in python (.py extension)._

In the comments at the top of each file, I also include the problem link statement (if available), the time and space complexity analysis, and additional notes about the solution.
